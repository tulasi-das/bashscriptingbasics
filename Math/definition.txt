Like python you cannot simply do 50 + 50 to add two numbers, in bash you have to use
commad expr(which represents expresssion, thae means it is going to evaluate the 
expressions)

We should use : expr "the expression comes here"

You cannot use * in bash for multiplicaion, because it is a wild card in bash. So you can
use escape /* for multiplicaion.

Refee the exaple for more understading
